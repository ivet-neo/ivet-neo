## Hello! 


My name is Iveta, I'm 26 years old and I am a Python developer in progress and relatively new to GitHub. ✨🐍\
\
I've completed 100 days of code on Udemy, done some projects by myself in Python (have passion especially for building useful, playful, and sometimes slightly chaotic apps) and currently building another one,  learning Pytest and testing in general. 🌱\
\
Gaming and computers have been part of my life and hobbies since I was little, and even though I came from a completely different life path, half a year ago I said - \
    - ***"Hey, why not try and connect work and hobby together?"*** - and that's what I am trying to accomplish now. 🔥\
    \
If there is any fellow programmer/fantasy geek who would like to be my guide or my study partner, or just chat (about Python or if Alliance/Horde is better), don't hesitate to reach out!\
I'd love to be part of the IT community trying to find out that typo in their code! 🙌\

*Fun fact: Did you know that Viggo Mortensen broke his toe while kicking a helmet as Aragorn in LoTR?* 😎
