## Hello! 


My name is Iveta and I am relatively new to programming and GitHub. âœ¨\
\
I've completed 100 days of code on Udemy, done some projects by myself in Python and now learning pytest and testing in general. ðŸŒ±\
\
Gaming and computers have been part of my life and hobbies since I was little, so half a year ago I said - \
    - ***"Hey, why not try and connect work and hobby together?"*** - and that's what I am trying to accomplish now. ðŸ”¥\
    \
If there is any fellow programmer/fantasy geek who would like to be my guide or my study partner, or just chat (about Python or if Alliance/Horde is better), don't hesitate to reach out!\
I'd love to be part of the IT community trying to find out that typo in their code! ðŸ™Œ\
\
*Fun fact: Did you know that Viggo Mortensen broke his toe while kicking helmet as Aragorn in LoTR?* ðŸ˜Ž
